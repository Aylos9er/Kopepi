We take security seriously at CopilotKit. Thank you for responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities you may find. By working together, we can keep the CopilotKit project and its users safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please send an email to **[security@copilotkit.ai](mailto:security@copilotkit.ai)**. This email address is delivered to a small security team dedicated to handling such issues.

- **Please include**: a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant information that may help us investigate and fix the issue efficiently.
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **24 hours**.
- If necessary, we may request additional information to further understand the issue.

## Follow-Up Process

- You will receive confirmation that we have begun investigating the issue.
- We will aim to provide a status update within **48 hours**.
- If we have not replied within **5 days**, please DM someone from the CopilotKit team in our community on Discord or GitHub.

Please be aware that our community is a public space. When reaching out in public channels, **do not disclose** the details of the vulnerability. Simply state that you're trying to reach someone from the security team.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Publicly disclosing vulnerabilities before we have addressed them could put users at risk, so we kindly ask that you refrain from doing so.

Thank you for helping to keep CopilotKit secure!
