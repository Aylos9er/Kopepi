As an industry, we are quickly learning (and re-learning) that **AI agents perform best when they work alongside humans**. It's far, far easier to get an agent to excel at specific things, than to perform the given task fully autonomously (see: self-driving cars).

But bridging between humans and AI agents is no small task. Until now.

**CopilotKit’s CoAgents provides infrastructure for connecting LangGraph agents to humans in the loop.**

# Features of a CoAgent

## Stream Intermediate Agent State

Stream the agent’s intermediate state to the application as the agent executes, so that the user can see work progressing, rather than stare at a loading spinner.

## Shared State Between Agent & Application

Bi-directional syncing between application state and agent state — to allow an agent and a human to collaborate on a task.

```tsx
const { state, setState } = useCoagent();
```

## Agent Q&A

Agents can easily and intentionally ask the user questions. With support for:

- **Text Feedback:** Via the chat UI.
- **Structured (JSON) Feedback:** Via fully custom UI/UX anywhere in your application (chat UI, modals, popups, forms, etc).

## Agent Steering (Coming Soon)

If needed, allow end-users to replay agent execution from a previous checkpoint, as well as correct agent mistakes.
