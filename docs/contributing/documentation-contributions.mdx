title: "Documentation Contributions"
---

We understand that as we move quickly, sometimes our documentation website can be a bit outdated. Therefore, we highly value contributions to our documentation.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 20.x or later

## Contributing to the Documentation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork The Repository">
    First, head over to the [CopilotKit repository](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit) and create a fork.

    Then, clone your fork to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CopilotKit
    cd CopilotKit/docs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Documentation Website Locally">
    To run the documentation website locally, simply run:
    ```bash
    npx mintlify dev
    ```

    This will open a new browser window with the documentation website.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your Changes">
    Now, you can make your changes to the documentation website.

    - All documentation-related files are located in the `docs` repository
    - `mint.json` contains the configuration for the Mintlify documentation site

    <Tip>
      For non-trivial documentation changes, we highly recommend reading the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) to undertand how Mintlify works.

    <Note>
      Please ensure you review your changes for grammar, spelling and formatting errors. Also, ensure that links and images are working.
    </Note>

    Once you are happy with your changes, you can commit and push them. Then, head over to the [Pull Requests page](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/pulls) and create a pull request. Thank you for your contribution!
