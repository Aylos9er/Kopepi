## Setup Local Environment

<Info>**Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 20.x).</Info>

Step 1. Install `pnpm` on your OS (version 9.5 or higher):

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g pnpm
```

```bash brew
brew install pnpm
```

```l other
https://pnpm.io/installation
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Install turbo v2.x on your OS:

<CodeGroup>```bash npm npm install -g turbo ```</CodeGroup>

Step 3. Install the required dependencies:

- Go to `<CopilotKit Directory>/CopilotKit/`
- Run `pnpm i`

Step 4. Add the required environment variables:

- Go to `<CopilotKit Directory>/CopilotKit/examples/next-openai/`
- Duplicate `.env.local.example`, name the duplicate `.env.local`
- Edit `.env.local` with approrpriate values

Step 5. Recursively install & build all dependencies:

In `<CopilotKit Directory>/CopilotKit` run:

```bash
turbo run freshbuild
```

Step 6. Run all packages & the example app in dev mode, to automatically load changes on file save.

Please Note!\
If you save files in a file that's part of the example app, the app will hot-load the changes automatically.
But if you make changes in a **package**, you first have to go to a file of the example app, and re-save it,
for the package changes to propagate into the running app.

In `<CopilotKit Directory>/CopilotKit/` run:

```bash
turbo run dev
```

To run the demos, go to `<CopilotKit Directory>/CopilotKit/examples/next-openai/` and run:

```bash
pnpm start:dev
```

By default the app will run on `http://localhost:3000`, however if 3000 is already taken, it will try other available ports sequentially.
To see which port was chosen, look in the output logs for something like

```bash
next-openai:dev: - ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3002, url: http://localhost:3002
```

## Testing your solution

Before submitting a pull request, please run the following locally:

1. Format your code:
   `turbo run format`

2. Make sure there are no build errors:
   `turbo run freshbuild`

3. Make sure tests are passing
   `turbo run test`

4. (Optional): Run QA test scripts
   We have some scripts in CopilotKit/scripts/qa that can help you test your changes.
   For example, to test your changes in a fresh NextJS app you can run `scripts/qa/next.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="npm is giving errors">
    Make sure you use `turbo`. See above.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unclear build error">
    Make sure you have specified the environment variables in `.env.local` as
    above.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Package changes not taking effect in example app">
    You can always try to clean and rebuild, by running `turbo run freshbuild`
    from the `<CopilotKit Directory>/CopilotKit` directory.
